This directory contains scripts to execute against the fp agent.

The agent information script (agent-info.sh) can be executed at any time.

getstats.sh can also be executed at any time and shows the transactions and state entry counts.

The bindclient.sh (maps the client Id used by other scripts to the 'default' tenant) MUST
be executed prior to operating any script successfully in this directory (except agent-info.sh and
getstats.sh).

Prior to manipulating contexts, the DPN must be added to the agent.
	Use as `adddpn.sh put` - Adds the target DPN.

You can verify the adddpn operation by looking at the result of `adddpn.sh get` or 
`get-topology.sh`

Contexts can be manipulated in order, e.g.
context_create.sh
context_update.sh
context_delete.sh

To use context_get.sh correctly the HTTP Notifier must be configured (see Agent Configuration parameters) 
and the HTTP server (in the httptest directory must be running).

unbindclient.sh should be executed after testing to free up the client identity mapping.
